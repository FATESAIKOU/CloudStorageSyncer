# Simplified Design Summary

## Architecture Overview

The CloudStorageSyncer implements a clean three-layer architecture:

```
CLI Layer (User Interface)
    ↓
Service Layer (Business Logic)
    ↓
Model Layer (Data Structures)
    ↓
External APIs (AWS S3)
```

## Core Components

### 1. Models Package (`src/cloud_storage_syncer/models/`)
- **S3Config**: Configuration management with validation
- **S3StorageClass**: Enumeration of AWS storage classes
- **UploadRequest**: Data transfer object for upload requests
- **UploadResult**: Data transfer object for upload results

### 2. Services Package (`src/cloud_storage_syncer/services/`)
- **S3Service**: Core S3 operations (upload, connection testing)
- **ConfigService**: Configuration file management

### 3. CLI Package (`src/cloud_storage_syncer/cli/`)
- **Main Application**: Entry point with command routing
- **Config Commands**: Configuration management commands
- **Upload Commands**: File upload commands (single, directory, batch)

## Key Features

### Configuration Management
- Interactive setup with connection testing
- Secure storage with restricted file permissions (0o600)
- Configuration validation and error handling
- Support for custom configuration file paths

### File Upload Operations
- Single file upload with custom S3 keys
- Directory upload with recursive option
- Batch upload from file lists
- Support for all AWS S3 storage classes
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

### User Experience
- Rich CLI interface with clear help messages
- Progress feedback and detailed error messages
- Emoji-enhanced output for better readability
- Consistent command structure and options

## Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear layer boundaries
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one main purpose
3. **Dependency Injection**: Services accept configuration objects
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management at all layers
5. **Type Safety**: Full type hints throughout the codebase
6. **User-Friendly**: Clear feedback and intuitive commands

This simplified design provides a solid foundation for the file upload functionality while maintaining clean architecture and extensibility for future features.
