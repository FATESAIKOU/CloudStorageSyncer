# CloudStorageSyncer Architecture

## 🏗️ System Overview

CloudStorageSyncer is designed as a modular, extensible CLI application for managing personal cloud storage with AWS S3.

## 🎯 Design Principles

1. **Modularity**: Clear separation between CLI, core logic, and storage layers
2. **Testability**: All components are unit testable
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new storage providers or features
4. **Simplicity**: Clean, readable code with minimal dependencies

## 📦 Package Structure

### `src/cloud_storage_syncer/`

#### `__init__.py`
- Package metadata (version, author, description)
- Main entry point for CLI application

#### `cli/`
CLI interface layer using Typer framework:
- `main.py`: Primary CLI application with commands
- Future: Subcommands for different operations

#### `core/`
Core business logic layer:
- Future: File operations, storage abstractions
- Future: Configuration management
- Future: Error handling and logging

### `tests/`
Comprehensive test suite:
- `test_basic.py`: Basic functionality and CLI tests
- Future: Integration tests, mock tests

## 🔄 Data Flow

```
User Input → CLI Layer → Core Logic → Storage Layer → AWS S3
           ↓
       CLI Output ← Response Processing ← API Response
```

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.13+
- **CLI Framework**: Typer
- **Testing**: pytest + pytest-cov + pytest-html
- **Code Quality**: ruff (formatting + linting)
- **Package Management**: uv
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Git Hooks**: pre-commit

## 🚀 Future Architecture Plans

### Phase 1: Basic File Operations (Current Goal)
- File upload to S3
- File download from S3
- File listing and search
- File deletion

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- Multiple storage classes support
- Configuration management
- Progress tracking
- Batch operations

### Phase 3: Web Interface
- Optional Flask web UI
- API endpoints
- Dashboard for file management

## 🔧 Configuration Strategy

Future configuration will support:
- YAML/TOML configuration files
- Environment variables
- CLI flags
- Default settings

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: All individual components
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflows
- **Mock Tests**: AWS S3 interactions
- **Performance Tests**: Large file operations
- **Coverage Target**: >90%

## 📈 Scalability Considerations

- Async operations for large files
- Chunked uploads/downloads
- Connection pooling
- Caching strategies
- Error retry mechanisms
